134,F6: DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox,Open Source Training,http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBnE4,z_assessor_11,11-368678,368678,Great well documented plan to leverage catalyst school to teach entrepreneurs on how to use open source tools to deliver their projects. Aligning training to a common set of open source tools will also help in auditing delivery of projects by making data about them in ingestible in common formats.,5,There is a well documented plan and the proposers have the experience to deliver the content. By lining up with Catalyst school the have access to the target audience to bring people into the program.,5,"Well documented plan with easy to audit deliverables. A number of KPI's have been outlined to measure success, though it would be great to see some goals set against these metrics to see how delivery compares to the expectations prior to launch and for voters to have an idea of expected impact.",5,,,

Project Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to support industry standard collaborative coding, tracking and documentation tools such as GitHub. 1000s of Cardano developers use version control tools such as GitHub, but there is often a gap in knowledge for early stage entrepreneurs who do not have the knowledge to take advantage of GitHub's organizational and collaborative features. 

The proposal directly addresses the challenge.",4,"Proposer has extensive experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. The plan is extremely detailed and well laid out. 

The proposer also partnered with the Catalyst School – QA-DAO which will offer introductory training materials for early stage entrepreneurs to develop skills in open-source tools such as GitHub and it will be a series of workshops comprising of a short screencast, screen share and a Q&A on the use of GitHub in Project Catalyst projects. 

The likelihood of success of this proposal is huge.",5,"The direction of the workshops will aim to discover participants workflows and examine how these may be documented, reported on, and automated using GitHub. This part of the proposal is offered in collaboration with F6: Improve and Grow Auditability.",4,,,

Whether the proposer can make a difference is less obvious. It looks like a lot of material already exists, and organizing it might be more important than making more. Even if great quality material is created—how will it be found? And how does this align with the interests of Catalyst?",3,"On the one hand, the proposer knows his stuff—but does he know what his public does or doesn't know? How do we tell? And how does this public intersect with the interests defended by Catalyst?",3,"The metrics are a bit handwavy, but most importantly, are not directly correlated with the interests of Cardano.",2,,x,"Simply stating that the metrics are ""handwavy"" is an insufficient assessment of auditability."

The ability to audit this proposal needs clearer metrics that can be easily viewed to determine if the proposal is successful. The use of surveys is subjective but will lend some visibility into the final product.",4,,,

This puts them at a disadvantage as they are not able to reap the benefits using Github. This proposal suggests a three pronged approach to helping people understand Github and allow them to use it to the fullest. The recording of workshops, published to be viewed in perpetuity is especially important as it allows the knowledge shared in the workshops to be accessed not just by those who are available at the time and also allows people to go back later and rewatch if they require a refresher. This strongly relies on marketing properly and getting the word out; although mentioned there is no indication on how this will be marketed to the community.",4,"It is shown that the experience as an educator is vast, this assures that the teaching component of this proposal will be executed properly. Also, previous resources created provide evidence that new resources will be of good quality. However, the skill of creating effective video resources is not expressly stated in this proposal, so it is hard to say whether these resources will be visually effective.",4,"Provided is a clear criteria to measure the success of this proposal. However in my opinion these criteria assess the ability for people to access these resources and not the effectiveness of the resources produced. The way shown to assess the effectiveness of the workshops is very difficult to quantify so alternate ways should be found, such as trying the workshop on people above the skill level of the target audience and asking for feedback or surveying participants.",2,,,

The idea in this proposal to create screencast and live workshops to teach those tools to new entrepreneurs really fit in the spirit of this challenge",5,"The team has vast experience in academic organization and is already collaboration with Catalyst School. The plan is well defined, with clear deliverables, due dates and how the budget was calculated. Base on that there is no doubt of the feasibility of the project.",5,The proposal defines when training material and workshops will be delivered. Each one was quantified in hours production that is tied with a per hour budget. That way makes simple and transparent the auditability of the project.,5,,,

The impact should be global although I am unsure if the proposer has a plan for scaling this. The recordings will undoubtedly be an important part in scalability however, language might be a challenge. It would be good to see this has been considered in the long term plan. Otherwise this is a well-written proposal that any voter should be able to understand, even with a simple skim read.",5,"It appears as though the proposer has the background necessary to organise this training however, he has not detailed whether he has the (presenting) skills to deliver online training. As someone who has had 10+ years developing and delivering online training in a corporate setting, Delivering quality online training that will be used in a vacuum, while appealing to and connecting with a passive audience - will require particular presenting ability. It would be good to know if the project proposer also has these skills or if he will be outsourcing this part of the project. 
Secondly, it would be good to understand the value split of the workshops vs the on-demand videos. The workshops seem like a great idea with good value-add. Will the scalability of this project be diminished if the workshops are a big part of the value proposition? 
Finally, it's great that there is a plan for where these resources will be stored and that there is a budget for marketing efforts, but it would be good to see some detail around outreach methods and means. So, will your primary focus be social media or will it be crypto events, town-halls or entrepreneur events etc?",4,"The key metrics are a good starting point and will go some way to measuring both the subjective and objective elements to training, however, it would be good to see hard numbers of goals. So, how many users are you hoping to have accessed the training/attended a workshop? What survey result/what differential are you hoping to see between those that have consumed the training vs not? Also, seeing as there is a budget outlined for marketing, it would be good to see some metrics around measuring the effectiveness of the marketing outreach.",4,,,

However I give 4 stars because the wording of the campaign is open to interpretation. Open source software is certainly a form of communication and allows for meaningful collaboration, but this proposal may better belong in the developer ecosystem challenge.",4,"the products are well defined and the proposer appears to have the experience, initiative, and partnerships to produce meaningful workshops related to open source tooling. I hope sufficient attention is given to marketing so that the resources are utilized as intended.",4,"8 workshops are proposed along with community documentation. Execution of these projects will be easy to observe. Attendance and surveys will be used to judge the impact, which seems reasonable.",4,,,
